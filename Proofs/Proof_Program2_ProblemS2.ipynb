    "# Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to arrange sculptures on platforms in a gallery where each sculpture has a height and width, and the platform has a width constraint. Sculptures must remain in their original order, and we seek to minimize the total height of all platforms. The sculpturesâ€™ heights follow a unimodal pattern, decreasing to a valley and then increasing. The objective is to assign the sculptures to platforms such that the total platform height is minimized, without exceeding the platform width limit `W`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Constraints\n",
    "- `n`: the number of sculptures.\n",
    "- `W`: the maximum allowable width of any platform.\n",
    "- `heights`: a list of integers representing the height of each sculpture.\n",
    "- `widths`: a list of integers representing the width of each sculpture.\n",
    "- The sculptures must be arranged in their original order.\n",
    "- The goal is to minimize the total platform height while adhering to the platform width limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Greedy Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ a greedy algorithm to partition the sculptures into platforms. The idea is to start from the larger side of the unimodal sequence (either left or right) and group sculptures into platforms based on width constraints. We attempt to place the valley sculpture and, if possible, add sculptures on either side of the valley if they fit within the width limit and maintain the order of sculptures. We also reverse the partitioning from the right side to ensure the correct sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proof of Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unimodal Structure**: The unimodal sequence ensures that we can split the sequence into two parts: a decreasing sequence (left) and an increasing sequence (right). The valley is the local minimum where the transition occurs. This structure guarantees that we can make decisions independently for the left and right sides when packing sculptures onto platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Greedy Choice Property**: The algorithm makes a series of locally optimal choices. We add sculptures to a platform from either side of the valley based on their width until the width constraint is violated. Once a platform is full, we start a new one. The greedy choice works because minimizing platform height is contingent upon keeping sculptures together as long as their widths allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Partitioning Logic**: The sculptures are processed from the side with the largest initial sculpture height (left or right). This ensures that the sculptures are grouped in a manner that balances platform height and width, avoiding the creation of unnecessary platforms. The valley is handled separately to ensure it is placed optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feasibility**: The algorithm always returns a valid partition since we strictly enforce the width limit and preserve the sculpture order. The sculptures are placed sequentially, with the largest allowed groups forming each platform, which is the core criterion for the problem's feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optimality**: The algorithm ensures that the total height is minimized by always selecting the tallest sculpture for each platform and grouping as many sculptures as possible within the width limit. This prevents suboptimal height configurations that would result from unnecessary fragmentation of sculptures onto additional platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Termination**: The algorithm processes each sculpture only once, either by adding it to a platform or starting a new platform. Since the number of sculptures `n` is finite, and each sculpture is eventually placed, the algorithm terminates after at most `n` steps. This guarantees that the algorithm halts with a valid solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time because it processes the sculptures in a single pass from both sides of the valley, checking widths and heights linearly. Each sculpture is placed in its optimal platform during a single traversal.\n"

    "## Proof of Correctness for the Sculpture Arrangement Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization and Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given `n` sculptures with heights `h1, ..., hn` and widths `w1, ..., wn`. The platform has a maximum width `W`, and the goal is to minimize the total height when the sculptures are placed on platforms. Each platform adjusts to the height of the tallest sculpture placed on it, and the width of sculptures on a platform cannot exceed `W`. The sculptures follow a unimodal sequence, decreasing to a valley and then increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm processes the sculptures in two phases: first partitioning from the left to the valley and then from the right back to the valley. It assigns sculptures to platforms while ensuring that the width limit `W` is not exceeded. The goal is to minimize the number of platforms and the total height.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Greedy Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by identifying the valley in the sculpture heights. From there, it processes the left partition (from index 0 to the valley) and the right partition (from the end back to the valley), aiming to place as many sculptures as possible on each platform without exceeding the width limit `W`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Greedy Choice**: At each step, the algorithm adds the next sculpture in sequence to the current platform, as long as the total width does not exceed `W`. When a new sculpture would exceed the width, the current platform is finalized, and a new platform is started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness by Induction:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will prove the correctness of the algorithm by induction on the number of sculptures `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base Case (`n = 1`):\n",
    "\n",
    "When `n = 1`, there is only one sculpture. The algorithm will place this single sculpture on a platform, and the total height will be the height of that sculpture. The width constraint is trivially satisfied, as a single sculpture will always fit on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the algorithm is correct for `n = 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the algorithm is correct for `n = k` sculptures. Specifically, it places the sculptures on platforms such that the total width on each platform does not exceed `W` and the total height is minimized by always placing the tallest sculpture on each platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inductive Step (`n = k+1`):\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the case with `n = k+1` sculptures. The algorithm proceeds by partitioning the sequence at the valley and processing each partition separately. By the inductive hypothesis, the algorithm correctly processes the first `k` sculptures and places them optimally on platforms. Now, we need to show that adding the `(k+1)`-th sculpture maintains the correctness of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left Partitioning**: The algorithm adds sculptures from left to the valley, ensuring that no platform exceeds the width `W`. If adding the next sculpture would exceed the width, the current platform is finalized, and a new one is opened. This guarantees that each platform's total width does not exceed `W`, and by always placing the tallest sculpture first, the total height is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Right Partitioning**: The algorithm processes the right partition in the same manner. It ensures that the sculptures are placed on platforms, and as long as the sculpture fits, it is placed on the same platform. This guarantees that the width limit is respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling the Valley**: The valley sculpture is placed either on the last left platform or the first right platform, whichever can accommodate it, without violating the width constraint. If neither side can accommodate it, the valley is placed on its own platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the valley is the lowest point in the unimodal sequence, placing it last ensures that the total height is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contradiction with Optimality:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume for contradiction that there exists a better solution that uses fewer platforms or achieves a lower total height. In such a solution, there would be some platform arrangement that places sculptures differently from the algorithm's greedy strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, any such arrangement would violate the width constraint or leave space on a platform that could have been used, contradicting the algorithm's greedy choice to fill each platform as much as possible before opening a new one. This ensures that no better solution exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By induction, the algorithm correctly places all `n` sculptures on platforms such that the total width on each platform does not exceed `W` and the total height is minimized. Therefore, the algorithm is **correct**.\n"
